# [Machine learning](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson4/ml-on-tabular-data.ipynb) vs [Deep learning](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson4/dl-on-tabular-data-using-fastai.ipynb) on Tabular data

Early on there was a lot of skepticism regarding the use of neural networks for tabular data. This [short experiment](https://medium.com/code-heroku/ml-vs-dl-for-tabular-data-8ae2992980eb) compares the 2 approaches and finds out if deep learning models can match the performance of machine learning models in case of tabular data. Results below:

# [Collaborative filtering](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson4/collaborative-filtering-with-fastai.ipynb)

Collaborative filtering is an application of machine learning where we try to predict whether a user will like a particular movie or product. Check out [my article on the same here](https://medium.com/@dipam44/collaborative-filtering-using-fastai-a2ec5a2a4049).

In this notebook we learn how to perform collaborative filtering on a song dataset in its most basic form. The dataset only has userID, songID and the rating as shown.
